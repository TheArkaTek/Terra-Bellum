# Terra-Bellum
The rules for the tabletop RPG Raleigh made

Character Creation:

ATTRIBUTES:

There are 7 attributes. 

ATK- Attack, a higher ATK stat makes it easier to hit
DEF- A stat that universally adds to AC and increases active defense checks
AGI- Damage with Ranged weapons. It also increases defense with Medium or Light Armor
STR- Damage with Melee weapons 
VIT- Determines your HP
KNW- Determines skill points per level
SPR- Determines how often you can use special attacks


Each attribute starts with a value of 0. You receive 11 points to spend between them. The cap at lvl 1 is 3. For every level thereafter the cap increases by 2. At each level you receive 2 points to spend on any stat you choose.

Attribute points: (9 + 2xLvl)
	Cap: (Lvl + 2)





















SKILLS:
There are two types of skills in the game. COMBAT SKILLS and NEUTRAL SKILLS. Combat skills would be any skill you use inside combat, likewise neutral skills would be skills used outside combat.

NEUTRAL SKILLS:

Cook (KNW):			Acrobatics (AGI):		Smith (KNW):				Brew (KNW):			Stealth (AGI):			*Intimidate (SPR):			
Fletch (KNW):			Notice (SPR):			*Persuade (SPR):			
Lore (KNW):			Sleight of Hand (AGI):		*Barter (SPR):				
Heal (KNW):												

*- This skill may only be used on NPCs

You receive 3+KNW points to distribute between neutral skills every level. You cannot make neutral skill checks without points in the skill. 




COMBAT SKILLS:

You receive 3+KNW points to distribute among combat skills. When making an attack check you add the appropriate skill to your attack (Pierce for spears, Bludgeon for hammers, Slash for axes, etc). This skill DOES NOT increase the damage, it only modifies the type of damage used. For every 3 points put into movement your movement speed increases by 5 ft, or one space. Dodge and Block increase your Active Defense, but not your Armor Class (AD, not AC). Poise is used with STR to resist status effects, and speed is added to your initiative. The cap is 3 at lvl 1, and increases by 1 every level thereafter.

Pierce:				Shoot:				Dodge:			Poise:		
Slash:				Throw:				Block:					
Bludgeon:			Move:				Speed:					

COM SKILL POINTS= (3+KNW) X Lvl
CAP= 2 + Lvl

Improved Dual Wielding: (Requires 10 AGI)
	You may use a non light weapon in your second hand as a light weapon.

COMBAT

HIT POINTS

HP= [20 + (2xVIT)] + [(10+Vit) x (Lvl-1)]

You start with twenty HP, and you add twice you Vitality to that. every level after your first you add ten plus your vitality to that total.

DEFENSE

Your Armor Class is your target number to be hit, the number an opponent must make on their attack roll in order to strike you. It is determined as such:

AC= 8 + Armor Bonus + DEF + AGI(if permitted)

Your agility bonus is only granted in full if wearing Light armor. If you wear Medium armor this bonus is halved (Rounded up) and if you are wearing heavy armor this bonus is denied. Light armor at lower levels generally grants 1-4 AC, Medium usually grants 3-6 AC, and Heavy Armor usually grants 5-8 AC. Each armor has its own unique bonuses (Or penalties) to Dodge and Block, so optimize your armor to your build!

ATTACK

Your attack is determined as such:

Attack= Weapon Bonus + COM SKILL + ATK

You add both your ATK attribute and your related combat skill to your attack check. 

For example:

Marcus a Pierce skill of 3, a Slash skill of 1, and an ATK attribute of 3. Mark picks the Longsword as his starting weapon, because he thinks it looks cool. A longsword deals slashing damage, so Mark adds the relevant skill plus his ATK for a total attack bonus of 4. He could have had a total attack bonus of 6 if he listened and picked a piercing weapon. 

SPIRIT

Your spirit is determined as such:

(3+SPR) per Level



INITIATIVE

INT is a number received at the start of each combat. Initiative is determined as such:

1d6 + Speed
	If action taken - 10
	If active defense (Or applicable special attack) is taken - 5
	If INT < 1 then player is finished for the round.

At the beginning of each combat each combat each player rolls a d6 and adds his or her speed combat skill. The player with the highest initiative moves first, then the person with the second highest, etc. But if your initiative is higher than ten you may act again at the “-10” initiative. For example if you rolled a 15 you could act on both 15 and 5, which would mean you could attack twice before anyone who rolled a four. In addition you can “Move” your initiative by taking an ACTIVE DEFENSE. On an active defense you choose your method of defense, dodge (AGI) or block (DEF). When you are using active defense you may roll a save against anyone who succeeds in an attack check against you, the target number of this save is the result of the successful attack check. If you succeed on this save no damage is dealt, and the attack is considered a failure. Taking an active defense lowers your initiative by 5, and the active defense remains in effect until your next action. For example-

Sammaticus and Jewshua are locked in deadly combat. Sammaticus rolls a 17 for his initiative, and Jewshua rolls a 13. Sammaticus moves first, and readies an active defense (Block) for Jewshua’s attack. This lowers Sammaticus’ initiative to 12, so Jewshua is next. Jewshua strikes his warhammer at Sammaticus’ face, rolling a 20 on his attack check, beating Sammaticus’ AC of 18. But because Sammaticus was prepared with an active defense he rolls his save before Jewshua can deal damage. If his Block skill plus his DEF doesn’t overcome the target number of 20 his face will be smashed to a bloody pulp. 

Another example demonstrating multiple attacks:

The Bullfighter, Torres, is poised to fight with the Lone Horn Jakesworth. Torres took initiative feats, while Jakesworth did not. Torres rolled a 21 on his initiative while Jakesworth rolled a 4. First Torres moves on 21, attacking with his spear. He strikes, drawing pixelated blood from the leg. Torres may strike again at 11, which also happens to be higher than Jakesworth’s 4. Torres strikes right into the chest this time, causing bleeding damage. Torres may strike again at 1, which is lower than 4, so it is Jakesworth’s turn to strike. He buries his axe into Torres’ neck ensuring initiative won’t reach 1.
